## When to use update_renv

The `update_renv()` function is designed to be used alongside the update to R from version 3.1.X to 3.4.X. Usually, use of the `renv` package is ideal in these circumstances, as it allows you to move R versions while keeping the same package versions (and your code functionality!). However, the change between these two versions of R includes breaking changes to the versioning of a few packages. 

This function works by updating the lockfile associated with a renv project. This updates only those packages which will break renv, leaving as many packages unaffected as possible.
